				<h2>How much time do I have to set aside?</h2>
				<p>It’s up to you, for the most part.</p>
				<p>Most people will spend 1-3 hours per week in the robotics room normally (it’s a good place to hang out with friends and teammates during lunch). We’ll also host occasional events, such as one-day robot builds, on various weekends.</p>
				<p>During our build season — January 6 through February 20 — students will generally spend 3-10 hours per week planning and working on the robot (during lunches, after school, and on weekends). You’ll also be expected to attend at least one competition: these are full-weekend commitments in March (specifics to come, tentatively those of the 9th and 23rd), with shuttle to and from school each evening and night.</p>
				<p>Don’t feel obligated to participate in everything we do, but do come to as much as you can and are interested in. Your participation won’t be as insignificant as in FBLA, but it’s also not as intense as a class. We’re here for fun, not drudgery! Instead of requiring you to come to every event, we seek to make you WANT to come as many as you can.</p>

				<h2>Will I be judged?</h2>
				<p>Our club is proud to be a meritocracy, where age, gender, race, and all personal characteristics are irrelevant in your participation. Ideas, in our club, are judged on their raw merits rather than their personal origin. Your logical propositions won’t be shouted down in favor of an inferior idea, even if the latter comes from someone who’s been on this Earth a little longer or strongly thinks they’re inherently better than you.</p>
				<p>We understand the challenges and stigmas many people can face — especially in engineering fields — and strongly believe that your effort and skill should be more valued than anything else. This belief, above all else, will be demonstrated in the structuring and administration of this club.</p>
