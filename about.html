				<h1>we're a robotics team in Kenmore, WA</h1>
				<p><strong>AHOY!</strong> we hail from Inglemoor High School, a public high school northeast of Lake Washington (the seattle water area) that is also known for its snobby IB program and really cool students.</p>
				<p>Every year (that we have funding), we compete in the <strong>FIRST Robotics Competition</strong> through FIRSTWA in the Pacific Northwest. Well, what does that mean?</p>
				<ol>
					<li>On the first Saturday in January during each year, there's a <strong>"kickoff" event</strong> where we learn the specific rules and dimensions and strategy elements for that year's game. That weekend, we meet for hours and strategize, coming up with our team's general strategy for the upcoming season.</li>
					<li>For six weeks, we have a <strong>build season</strong> in which we design and build our ENTIRE robot! We meet after school every day for 1-3 hours during this period; it's quite intense. At the end of it, we seal our robot in a bag to store it until competition.</li>
					<li>On two weekends in March (varying each year), we compete! One of our competitions is at Mount Vernon HS, and one at Glacier Peak HS. Both follow the same format:
						<ul>
							<li>Friday: doors open at 5 PM, and we go in to set up out "pit" (workspace). We also test our robot during this time, and have it pass a safety &amp; functionality inspection. We're there from 5 PM - 9 PM.</li>
							<li>Saturday: The bulk of competition (quite tedious at times) happens on this day. We start a "round robin" section of the tournament, in which each team plays with and against each other team for average-aggregated ranking points. We're there from 8 AM - 8 PM.</li>
							<li>Sunday: The end of Round Robin results in an "Alliance Selection" event, where the top 8 seeds assemble their 3-team alliances in preparation for an 8-alliance single-elimination tournament. Then, this tournament takes place, followed by an awards ceremony. We're there from 8 AM - 5 PM.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Doing all this requires a lot of money! If you represent a local business, we commonly do sponsorship deals where we can promote your business for help in registration and building costs. If you or someone you know works at a large local corporation (Microsoft, Boeing, Google, etc), many of them have sponsorship programs through employees! We'd love to have your help, it lets us give incredible high school experiences to students and inspire their careers.
